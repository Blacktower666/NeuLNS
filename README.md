Learn to Design Heuristics for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), by Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. This project provides the code to replicate the experiments in the paper:

Learn to Design the Heuristics for Vehicle Routing Problem

Please install vrp_env-0.1.1 before training or evaluation. run train_model.py
to train a cvrp/cvrptw model, and evaluation.py to evaluate on the test data. The
default arguments can be found in arguments.py.

Example:
python train_model.py -n 99 -c 100
